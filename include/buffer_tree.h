 * Quick and dirty buffer tree skeleton.
 * Metadata about buffers (buffer control blocks) will be stored in memory.
 * The root buffer will be stored in memory.
 * All other buffers will be primarily stored on disk.
 * The tree operates read-lazily, only reading (non-root) buffers into memory
 *    if they need to be flushed.
 * Flushing and flush-related work is handled by a dynamic thread pool.
 * A flush queue will be maintained, from which threads pick tasks.
 * DESIGN NOTE: Currently, a buffer cannot flush to another buffer that needs to
 * be flushed. This is to prevent starvation.
